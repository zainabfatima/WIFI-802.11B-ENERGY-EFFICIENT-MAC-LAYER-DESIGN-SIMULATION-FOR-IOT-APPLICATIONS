# WIFI-802.11B-ENERGY-EFFICIENT-MAC-LAYER-DESIGN-SIMULATION-FOR-IOT-APPLICATIONS
New technologies and protocols are the key to meet current and future demands in this new era of connectivity. IoT applications increases the WI-FI based communication devices usage because it is most efficient and reliable protocol which satisfies all IoT applications demands and make our life more convenient. But only limiting factor is its power consumption so, with this exponential increase in Wi-Fi devices use, there is need a way to reduce their total operating power so that they can have more up time.  The main goal  is to design the energy efficient 802.11b compatible  MAC layer that facilitate communication in IoT applications.in first stage of this project the WLAN 802.11b MAC layer which is based on CSMA/CA with DCF  will be designed and simulated in MATLAB environment . In second stage of project the performance analysis by modifying standard packet lengths and other features which are overhead in IoT applications will be carried out. This is necessary and will be very helpful for optimization of MAC layer in next stage. After analyzing performance the new subset of WLAN 802.11 MAC layer will be proposed and designed. In last stage, proposed energy efficient MAC protocol that is suitable for IoT applications will be simulated and evaluated for different type of data transmissions.
