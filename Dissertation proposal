1.	Introduction
In recent year, the popularity of WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) has generated much interest on improvement and performance analysis of the IEEE802.11 protocol [1]. The IEEE 802.11 protocol defines the MAC (Medium Access Control) and the physical layer functions of WLANs. The 802.11 MAC layer is technically a sublayer of the data link layer (DLL). It rides above the physical layer, controlling transmission of data and providing interaction with a wired backbone, if one exists. The MAC layer also provides services related to the radio and mobility management. The 802.11 MAC layer is required to appear to a logical link control (LLC) layer as an IEEE 802 LAN, thus Wi-Fi and Ethernet both use MAC addresses in the same format, i.e., 6 octets that are globally unique.
2.	Motivation
The IoT represents a vision where the internet stretches to the real world comprising every-day objects and physical items that are connected to the virtual world. The items can physically act as access points to internet services and they can be controlled and monitored remotely .This then brings out the idea of acquiring data from the environment, process that data and use it to obtain a benefit, and the way to make this happen is by deploying a network of sensors which will provide an application with the desired sensed data. New technologies and protocols are the key to meet current and future demands.
According to feasibility study of existing communication protocols the most suitable protocol for IoT is “802.11” and it’s enhance versions [3]. But the limiting factor is its energy consumption. This motivate the idea of to design energy efficient enhancements in protocol that facilitate communication in IoT application.in IoT applications the amount of data transmission is very less so, standard large data packets transmission is unnecessary.
The motivation for this project is realization of custom energy efficient 802.11b compliant protocol that will fulfill the present and future communication needs. This will play a huge role in this new era of connectivity. More over Wi-Fi market is monopolize by  few companies  which are making Wi-Fi chips this project enable us to develop custom Wi-Fi chip set because the physical layer already developed in previous project. 




3.	Project Summary
New technologies and protocols are the key to meet current and future demands in this new era of connectivity. IoT applications increases the WI-FI based communication devices usage because it is most efficient and reliable protocol which can satisfy all IoT applications demands and make our life more convenient. But only limiting factor is its power consumption so, with this exponential increase in Wi-Fi devices use, there is need a way to reduce their total operating power so that they can have more up time. 
The main goal  is to design the energy efficient 802.11b compatible  MAC layer that facilitate communication in IoT applications.in first stage of this project the WLAN 802.11b MAC layer which is based on CSMA/CA with DCF  will be designed and simulated in MATLAB environment . In second stage of project the performance analysis by modifying standard packet lengths and other features which are overhead in IoT applications will be carried out. This is necessary and will be very helpful for optimization of MAC layer in next stage. After analyzing performance the new subset of WLAN 802.11 MAC layer will be proposed and designed. In last stage, proposed energy efficient MAC protocol that is suitable for IoT applications will be simulated and evaluated for different type of data transmissions.

4.	Project Methodology
4.2.	  Organization of the Standard
The IEEE 802.11b standard is broken into two main layers: the MAC or Media Access Control layer and the PHY or Physical Layer. These two layers allow a functional separation of the standard and, more importantly allows a single data protocol to be used with several different RF transmission techniques.
4.3.	Communication Layers Structure
In comparison with the OSI model of the ISO [7], the Wi-Fi standard species the following Layer 2 and Layer 1 communication protocols: 

 

Figure 1: OSI model and WI-FI layers

Layer 1, known as the Wi-Fi PHY, is also divided in two separate sub layers, the Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) and the Physical Medium De-pendent (PMD). 
Layer 2 is divided in two sub layers, the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) and the IEEE 802.11 MAC sub layer. As shown in above diagram.
4.4.	Overview of Mac layer
Before transmitting frames, a station must first gain access to the medium, which is a radio channel that stations share. The 802.11 standard defines two forms of medium access, distributed coordination function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF). DCF is mandatory and based on the CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) protocol. Prior to transmitting a frame, a station calculates the amount of time necessary to send the frame based on the frame’s length and data rate. The station places a value representing this time in the duration field in the header of the frame. When stations receive the frame, they examine this duration field value and use it as the basis for setting their corresponding network allocation (NAVs). This process reserves the medium for the sending station [8].this process is shown in figure 2.

Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)
 Medium Access control [MAC] layer performs function like:
1.	On transmission, assemble data in to a frame with address and error detection fields
2.	On reception, disassemble frame and perform address recognition and error detection 
3.	Govern access to the LAN transmission medium.

4.5.	MAC Layer in Detail
4.5.1.	CSMA/CA
CSMA/CA Wi-Fi uses CSMA/CA to divide the medium resources among all users, unlike the Ethernet protocol which uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). This is due to the lack of ability to listen to the entire medium permanently. CSMA is a MAC protocol designed for shared mediums where stations or users must compete in order to use the medium during a certain amount of time. This technique implies the ability for all communicating entities to listen to the medium. In which case, the stations must wait for the medium to be free if the carrier sensing finds the medium busy. Therefore collisions occur only when, due to the propagation delay, two stations find the medium to be free. This type of Multiple Access also involves the fact that a certain transmission is received by all other stations using the medium thus requiring for better overall security measures to be applied such as authentication, confidentiality and integrity. 
P-persistent carrier sensing technique is used in CSMA/CA which reduces the number of collisions by waiting a random time if the channel is sensed to be free. The procedure this access mode follows to generate successful transmissions is:
1.	Wait for a packet to be ready for tx.
2.	Check if the medium is busy.
3.	If the medium is busy, then the station retains the packet until the medium becomes available.
4.	If the medium is free then the packet is sent with a packet is sent with a probability p. This is done by generating a random number [0, 1] and comparing it with p.
5.	If the packet is decided not to be sent, then the transmitter waits a certain time before retrying.
6.	In case of collision, the station waits a random time and goes back to carrier sensing on step 2.
7.	If an ACK packet is received then the transmission has been successful.
If the channel is found occupied CSMA, collision avoidance adds a random exponential back-off time making it more efficient by not sensing the channel all the time. This specific type of CSMA is used in wireless mediums where collisions are much harder to detect and transmitting stations cannot sense the medium and send data at the same time.
4.5.2.	DCF: Distributed Coordination Function
The DCF, based on CSMA/CA allows multiple independent stations to interact without central control, and thus may be used in either Ad-hoc or infrastructure networks [10, 11]. There are two techniques used for packet transmitting in DCF. The default one is a two-way handshaking mechanism, also known as basic access method. A positive MAC Acknowledgement (ACK) is transmitted by the destination station to signal the successful packet transmission. The other optional one is a four-way hand-shaking mechanism, which uses RTS/CTS technique to reserve the channel before data transmission. However, the drawback of RTS/CTS mechanism is the increased overhead for short data frames.
4.5.3.	Frame Format
4.5.3.1.	General frame format
A common frame generated by the MAC layer is as follows:
 
Figure 3: General frame format

The minimum MAC frame format has the following structure: [Frame Control, Duration/ID, Address1, and FCS], rest of the fields being optional or specific to certain frame exchanges. The standard does also specify the maximum MSDU size at 2304 bytes.
4.5.3.2.	Data Frames
Data frames follow the same format as the general frame format, except for the usage of the Address fields that may vary its content depending on who it is addressed to. 
MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit) Preparation chain
When a Data transmission occurs, the frame being sent needs to go throw a preparation flow first. This preparation diagram is shown in the following figure included in the standard:

 
Figure 4: MPDU preparation chain
4.5.3.3.	Control frames
 Control frames are such those that are preceded by a SIFS interval and present the following Frame Control field configuration:
 

Figure 5: Frame Control field format for Control Frames
4.5.3.4.	Management Frame
 
Figure 6: General Management frame format

The numerous types of management frames are out of the study of this work. Most of the management frames are used to do certain handshake procedures such as authentication or association in the network. These frames are transmitted the same way as data frames, but not always forwarded to upper layers as the information they carry does only concern to the 802.11 network architecture and is irrelevant to upper layers.
4.6.	System Software and Simulation
The above described standard 802.11 MAC layer and modified energy efficient MAC will be implemented on MATLAB Simulink environment. The simulations and results can be viewed on Simulink.
